1. Mac Books Introduction

This app provides a book trade system to Macalester students. The user can get a book at a lower price than buy the book at a bookstore or online very quickly without having to wait for a book to be shipped. The user can log into the system by using the google account and search for the book wanted, and get the seller information so that they can contact each other. 

2. Procedures
2.1 You have to have a google account set up on your device to log into our system. To search for a book, click on the search bar on the main page. You can put in the book ISBN number, the book title or the author name to search for the book. After the available books show up on the screen, click on the book field for detailed information. If you decide to buy a book, click 'Buy' and send an e-mail to the seller to notify the seller that you want this book.

2.2 If you want to sell a book, click on the 'Sell Book' button. You can input the book information including the ISBN, the book title and the author name. Then you can set the price of the book. It has to be at least 2 dollars. Click 'Search and Add', select the exact book you want to sell. Then, your book information will be stored in our database and displayed in the book list on the main page. 

2.3 Click on the 'My Profile' button, and it will show your personal information, including your name and e-mail address.
